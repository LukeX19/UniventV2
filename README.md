**Univent** is a web-based event management platform tailored for university students and administrators. It enables students to discover, join, and host academic or social events, while administrators manage user access, universities, and event categories. The application integrates artificial intelligence to enhance user interaction through personalized event suggestions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. **.NET 8 SDK**: Required for running the backend. [Download .NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
2. **Node.js**: Required for running the frontend. [Download Node.js 18+ LTS](https://nodejs.org/)
3. **Angular CLI 18**: Required for running the frontend.
```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli@18
```

### Cloning the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LukeX19/UniventV2
```

## Running the Project

### Backend (API)
Before running the backend, make sure your `appsettings.json` or `secrets.json` file is properly configured with the following credentials and keys:
- Database connection string
- AWS S3 access credentials
- GitHub Marketplace Models Key & OpenWeatherMap API keys
- JWT signing key

The file should look like this:
```bash
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "MSSQLServer": "YOUR_KEY"
  },
  "JwtSettings": {
    "SigningKey": "YOUR_KEY",
    "Issuer": "UniventAPI",
    "Audiences": [ "Swagger-Client" ]
  },
  "AWSS3StorageSettings": {
    "BucketName": "YOUR_BUCKET_NAME",
    "Region": "YOUR_REGION",
    "AccessKey": "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY",
    "SecretKey": "YOUR_SECRET_KEY",
    "S3BaseUrl": "YOUR_BASE_URL"
  },
  "OpenWeatherMap": {
    "ApiKey": "YOUR_KEY"
  },
  "GitHubAIModels": {
    "Endpoint": "https://models.github.ai/inference",
    "ApiKey": "YOUR_KEY",
    "Model": "YOUR_CHOSEN_AI_MODEL"
  }
}
```

Once configured, donâ€™t forget to apply the latest database migrations.

Steps to run the Backend:

1. Navigate to the API Project:
```bash
cd Univent.Api
```
2. Restore Backend Dependencies:
```bash
dotnet restore
```
3. Build the Backend:
```bash
dotnet build Univent.Api
```
4. Run the Backend:
- Start the API server:
```bash
dotnet run --project Univent.Api
```
- The API should be running at https://localhost:7019 (or another port if configured).
- Experienced users may skip steps 2 and 3, as `dotnet run` handles them automatically.

### Frontend (Client)
Before running the frontend, make sure to create the `src/environments` folder with 2 environment files: `environment.prod.ts` and `environment.ts`.
The files should look like this:
```bash
// environment.prod.ts
export const environment = {
  production: true,
  apiUrl: 'api/',
  googleMapsApiKey: 'YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY'
};


// environment.ts
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  apiUrl: 'https://localhost:7019/api',
  googleMapsApiKey: 'YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY'
};
```
Steps to run the Frontend:

1. Navigate to the Frontend Project:
```bash
cd client/Univent
```
2. Install Dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
3. Run the Frontend:
- Start the development server:
```bash
ng serve
```
- The frontend should be running at http://localhost:4200 by default.

## API Documentation

The backend API includes an interactive documentation that allows you to explore and test available endpoints directly from your browser.
